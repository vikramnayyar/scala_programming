## Scala for Data Engineering Roadmap

### 1. **Get Comfortable with Scala Basics**

* Understand Scala syntax and basics (variables, data types, functions, control structures).
* Learn about Scala’s object-oriented and functional programming features.
* Practice with collections (List, Array, Map, Set) and higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce).
* Understand immutability and case classes.
* Explore pattern matching and options (handling nulls safely).
* Resources:

  * [Scala Official Documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/)
  * Books: *“Programming in Scala”* by Odersky et al.
  * Interactive tutorials: [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/)

### 2. **Scala Advanced Concepts (for Big Data)**

* Understand traits and mixins.
* Learn about Futures and concurrency.
* Explore implicit parameters and conversions.
* Learn about for-comprehensions.
* Understand error handling with Try, Either.
* Study collections in depth (mutable vs immutable).

### 3. **Scala for Data Engineering Tools**

* **Apache Spark with Scala**

  * Understand Spark’s core concepts (RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets).
  * Learn how to write Spark jobs using Scala.
  * Practice Spark transformations and actions.
  * Understand Spark SQL and Spark Streaming.
  * Learn how to integrate with data sources (HDFS, S3, Kafka).
  * Optimize Spark jobs and understand partitioning/shuffle.

* **Build ETL Pipelines**

  * Use Scala with Spark to build scalable ETL pipelines.
  * Work with structured and semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet, Avro).
  * Understand schema evolution and data serialization formats.

* **Big Data Ecosystem Integration**

  * Explore how Scala integrates with Hadoop ecosystem.
  * Learn to use Apache Kafka for streaming with Scala.
  * Explore Apache Flink or Akka Streams (optional but useful).

### 4. **Project & Practice**

* Build a small data pipeline project using Scala and Spark (e.g., ingest, transform, and store data).
* Write Spark batch jobs and streaming jobs.
* Work on real datasets (e.g., NYC Taxi Data, Kaggle datasets).
* Deploy Spark jobs on a cluster (local, cloud-based, or managed services like Databricks).
* Use version control (Git) for your projects.

### 5. **Supplement with Data Engineering Concepts**

* Study distributed computing basics.
* Learn about data modeling and warehousing.
* Understand workflow orchestration (Airflow, Prefect).
* Get familiar with cloud services (AWS EMR, GCP Dataproc, Azure HDInsight).

### 6. **Optional: Learn Functional Programming Paradigms Deeply**

* Since Scala is a functional-first language, diving deeper into functional programming can help write clean, scalable, and robust code.
* Explore libraries like Cats and Scalaz (advanced).
